<p>A <strong>web browser</strong> is a software application used for accessing resources on the internet, and various browsers are used by millions of people every day (you are even using one right now). </p>

<p>While there are many little-used web browsers, the main desktop web browsers in use world wide are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://google.com/chrome" title="Chrome Browser - Get a Fast, Free Web Browser">Chrome</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://mozilla.org/firefox/" title="Mozilla Firefox - Different By Design">Firefox</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://apple.com/safari/" title="Safari - The Official Apple Web Browser">Safari</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://opera.com" title="Opera - Start your journey">Opera</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/ie" title="Internet Explorer - The Official Microsoft Web Browser">Internet Explorer</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://browsehappy.com/" title="See current browser versions.">most recent versions</a> of all of these are strong, standards-compliant browsers. However, older versions of these browsers, like Firefox 3 or Internet Explorer 8, are <strong>not</strong> standards compliant. If you are using an old version of one of these browsers, I recommend upgrading to a version that supports the features we&#8217;ll be using throughout this guide.</p>

<p>So, there are five main desktop web browsers. Why are there so many, and what makes them different from each other?</p>

<p>Browsers differ in many ways, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interface</li>
  <li>How they handle HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other languages</li>
  <li>How quickly they run</li>
  <li>What company makes them</li>
  <li>How often they are updated</li>
  <li>How customizable they are</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these differences are great for consumers, because they have a wide array of options to choose from when picking how they want to access the web.</p>

<p>However, it can be a nightmare for web developers, because instead of there being a single, reliable implementation of the languages we use, there are several widely-used, competing implementations.</p>

<p>But what are these implementations exactly?</p>
