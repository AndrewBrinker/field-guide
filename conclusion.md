# Chapter 5 - Conclusion

Things have only just begun.

## Going Further

You've done it. You've completed the entirety of the Front End Development
Field Guide. Take a moment. Breathe it in. That's not a meager accomplishment.
So give yourself a hand.

There's a lot more to do though. It is my sincere hope that the process of
working through this guide has instilled in you a desire to do more on the web.
If you want to learn more, there's a lot to learn (check out the resources
section for a ton of links to good web development content); if you want to make
things, start making things. You don&rsquo;t need a web host or a domain name
(although you can get both of those things if you'd like), you just need a
computer and a desire to make cool stuff.

So look around, check out sites like
[Move the Web Forward](http://movethewebforward.org) and
[A List Apart](http://alistapart.com). They're full of information with a ton of
useful links. A List Apart has articles from some of the smartest minds in web
development.

There's a lot to learn and do on the web. So just keep working, and most of all,
never forget to have a hell of a lot of fun.
