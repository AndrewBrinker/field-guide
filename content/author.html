<p>My name is <a href='http://andrewbrinker' title='AndrewBrinker.com' target='_blank'>Andrew Brinker</a>. As you learned in the intro to the site, I&rsquo;ve been making websites since I was twelve years old. I originally started working on this site so it could be used for CSE 322, Web Programming, at California State University, San Bernardino (where I am a Junior computer science major and math minor).</p>
<p>Although this site began as a project for use in a course, it is not limited in usefulness to only those students. I remember when I was starting out in web development, and the way that I learned. I Googled, I read Stack Overflow, and while I learned a lot it was all incredibly haphazard. It took a lot of time to learn how to do things right. In the end, it is my sincere hope that the users of this site feel that they&rsquo;ve learned more than just how to make websites, but that they&rsquo;ve learned how to make websites right.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in reading my writings, feel free to check out my blog, <a href='http://suspectsemantics.com' title='Suspect Semantics' target='_blank'>Suspect Semantics</a>. I also periodically post on Alpha, so <a href='http://alpha.app.net/brinker' title='Brinker @ App.net' target='_blank'>feel free to follow me</a> there.</p>
<p>I currently work in the Pfau Library IT Department at CSU, San Bernardino as a Student Assistant doing web development (surprising, right?).</p>
