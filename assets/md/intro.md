The Web Development Field Guide is a web-based book intended to provide readers the knowledge and resources needed to become professional web developers.

<h2 id='why-this-exists'><a href='#why-this-exists' title='Why This Exists'>Why This Exists</a></h2>

Web development is a discipline with a lot of resources available around the web, but individuals trying to enter the fields encounter several problems:

- The books on web development are often outdated
- Googling is too haphazard
- W3Schools (which ranks highest for many web-related searches) is a terrible resource that consistently provides incorrect information

This book was made to be a single source of information, with a mix of text, screencasts, examples, and exercises that anyone can use to become a web developer.

The book is a constant work in progress, and if you have any suggestions or corrections, please feel free to [get in touch with me][contact].

This book is for anyone and everyone with an interest in web development. The web is a platform of equal opportunity, and this book is written with the varying skills of readers in mind. If you are worried about not knowing enough, or not being ready, don't worry.

This book is also for more experienced developers looking to brush up or grow their knowledge. If you are a more advanced developer, you may want to view some of the advanced topics (labelled "advanced" on the Table of Contents), or peruse some of the further reading at the bottom of each section.

This book doesn't want to push any particular paradigm or methodology for development. The few times I address methodologies for development, I attempt to share both the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. The methods you use when developing are entirely your own decision, and methods will not be recommended here.

With all that out of the way, prepare to enter the wilds of web development. Bring your paper, your pencil, and be ready to learn. This book may move quickly at time, so never feel pressured to move more quickly than you are ready for. If at any point something isn't clear, feel free to google it, or ask on Stack Overflow, or ask on Twitter, or anywhere else you want to ask. The web development community is very helpful, and I guarantee that someone can help you with whatever you're stuck on.
