A __web browser__ is a software application used for accessing resources on the internet, and various browsers are used by millions of people every day (you are even using one right now). 

While there are many little-used web browsers, the main desktop web browsers in use world wide are:

- [Chrome][google-chrome]
- [Firefox][mozilla-firefox]
- [Safari][apple-safari]
- [Opera][opera]
- [Internet Explorer][internet-explorer]

The <a href='http://browsehappy.com/' title='See current browser versions' class='external'>most recent versions</a> of all of these are strong, standards-compliant browsers. However, older versions of these browsers, like Firefox 3 or Internet Explorer 8, are __not__ standards compliant. If you are using an old version of one of these browsers, I recommend upgrading to a version that supports the features we'll be using throughout this guide.

So, there are five main desktop web browsers. Why are there so many, and what makes them different from each other?

Browsers differ in many ways, including:

- Interface
- How they handle HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other languages
- How quickly they run
- What company makes them
- How often they are updated
- How customizable they are

All of these differences are great for consumers, because they have a wide array of options to choose from when picking how they want to access the web.

However, it can be a nightmare for web developers, because instead of there being a single, reliable implementation of the languages we use, there are several widely-used, competing implementations.

But what are these implementations exactly?
