%p A <strong>web browser</strong> is a software application used for accessing resources on the internet, and various browsers are used by millions of people every day (you are even using one right now). 

%p While there are many little-used web browsers, the main desktop web browsers in use world wide are:

%ul
    %li 
        %a(href='http://google.com/chrome' title='Get a Fast, Free Web Browser!') Chrome
    %li
        %a(href='http://mozilla.org/firefox' title='Mozilla Firefox - Different By Design') Firefox
    %li
        %a(href='http://apple.com/safari' title='Safari - The Official Apple Web Browser') Safari
    %li
        %a(href='http://opera.com' title='Opera - Start Your Journey') Opera
    %li
        %a(href='http://windows.microsoft.com/ie' title='Internet Explorer - The Official Microsoft Web Browser') Internet Explorer

%p The <a href='http://browsehappy.com/' title='See current browser versions' class='external'>most recent versions</a> of all of these are strong, standards-compliant browsers. However, older versions of these browsers, like Firefox 3 or Internet Explorer 8, are <strong>not</strong> standards compliant. If you are using an old version of one of these browsers, I recommend upgrading to a version that supports the features we&rsquo;ll be using throughout this guide.

-# BROWSER DIFFERENCES

    %a(href='#browser-differences' title='Browser Differences') Browser Differences 

%p So, there are five main desktop web browsers. Why are there so many, and what makes them different from each other?

%p Browsers differ in many ways, including:

%ul
    %li Interface
    %li How they handle HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other languages
    %li How quickly they run
    %li What company makes them
    %li How often they are updated
    %li How customizable they are

%p All of these differences are great for consumers, because they have a wide array of options to choose from when picking how they want to access the web.

%p However, it can be a nightmare for web developers, because instead of there being a single, reliable implementation of the languages we use, there are several widely-used, competing implementations.

%p But what are these implementations exactly?
