Here's the Guy Who Wrote This

## About

My name is [Andrew Brinker](http://andrewbrinker.com). As you learned in the
intro to the site, I've been making websites since I was twelve years old. I
originally started working on this site so it could be used for CSE 322, Web
Programming, at California State University, San Bernardino (where I
graduated in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science).

Although this site began as a project for use in a course, it is not limited
in usefulness to only those students. I remember when I was starting out in web
development, and the way that I learned. I Googled, I read Stack Overflow, and
while I learned a lot it was all incredibly haphazard. It took a lot of time to
learn how to do things right. In the end, it is my sincere hope that the users
of this site feel that they've learned more than just how to make websites, but
that they've learned how to make websites right.
